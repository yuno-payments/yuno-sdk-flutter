/// {@template commons_YunoPlatform}
/// ## YunoPlatform
///
/// The `YunoPlatform` class serves as an abstraction layer to unify and streamline
/// communication with various underlying platform implementations of the Yuno SDK.
/// It provides a set of methods to initialize the SDK, handle payments (both standard and "lite"),
/// manage loaders, handle incoming deeplinks, and more.
///
/// ### Retrieving an Instance
///
/// To access the current platform implementation, you can use:
///
/// ```dart
/// final instance = YunoPlatform.instance;
/// ```
///
/// This instance will point to a platform-specific implementation, such as the default
/// method channel implementation (`YunoMethodChannel`), or a custom one provided
/// by a third-party platform class.
///
/// ### Custom Platform Implementations
///
/// Platform-specific implementations should:
/// 1. Extend `YunoPlatform`.
/// 2. Provide a token validation via `PlatformInterface.verifyToken`.
/// 3. Assign themselves to the static `instance` field for use throughout the app.
///
/// By default, `YunoPlatform` uses the `YunoMethodChannel` implementation, but you can
/// override it at runtime:
///
/// ```dart
/// final myCustomPlatform = MyCustomPlatform();
/// YunoPlatform.instance = myCustomPlatform;
/// ```
///
/// This flexibility ensures that developers can plug in their own platform-specific
/// implementations without modifying the core application code.
///
/// {@endtemplate}
abstract interface class YunoPlatform extends PlatformInterface {
  /// Constructs a [YunoPlatform] and provides a verification token to ensure
  /// platform integrity.
  ///
  /// This constructor should only be called by the platform-specific implementation.
  YunoPlatform() : super(token: _token);

  /// A unique token used for verifying the authenticity of the provided platform implementation.
  ///
  /// Internal use only. Passed to the superclass [PlatformInterface] for verification.
  static final Object _token = Object();

  /// Holds a reference to the currently active [YunoPlatform] implementation.
  ///
  /// By default, this is set to the result of:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// const YunoMethodChannelFactory().create()
  /// ```
  ///
  /// You can replace it with a custom platform implementation as needed.
  static YunoPlatform _instance = const YunoMethodChannelFactory().create();

  /// The default instance of [YunoPlatform] to use throughout the application.
  ///
  /// This returns the currently set platform instance. If no custom implementation
  /// is assigned, it defaults to the `YunoMethodChannel` based implementation.
  ///
  /// Example:
  /// ```dart
  /// final instance = YunoPlatform.instance;
  /// ```
  static YunoPlatform get instance => _instance;

  /// Sets the instance of [YunoPlatform] to be used.
  ///
  /// Use this setter when you have a custom platform implementation that you want
  /// the application to use, for instance:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// YunoPlatform.instance = MyCustomYunoPlatform();
  /// ```
  ///
  /// It verifies that the provided [instance] is legitimate by calling [PlatformInterface.verifyToken].
  static set instance(YunoPlatform instance) {
    PlatformInterface.verifyToken(instance, _token);
    _instance = instance;

  /// Initializes the Yuno SDK with the necessary configuration.
  ///
  /// This method must be called before invoking other payment-related methods.
  ///
  /// Parameters:
  /// - [apiKey]: Your unique API key provided by Yuno.
  /// - [countryCode]: The ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code where the payment is taking place.

  /// - [iosConfig]: (Optional) An [IosConfig] object with iOS-specific setup parameters.
  /// - [androidConfig]: (Optional) An [AndroidConfig] object with Android-specific setup parameters.
  ///
  /// Example:
  /// ```dart
  /// await YunoPlatform.instance.initialize(
  ///   apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  ///   countryCode: 'US',
  ///   yunoConfig: YunoConfig(),

  /// - [countryCode]: The ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code for the payment.
