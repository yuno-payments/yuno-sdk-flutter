## Installation
```sh
dart pub add yuno
```

## Requirements

#### Android
This plugin requires several changes to be able to work on Android devices. Please make sure you follow all these steps:

1. Yuno Android SDK needs your minSdkVersion to be 21 or above.
2. Your project must have Java 8 enabled and use AndroidX instead of older support libraries
3. The android-gradle-plugin version must be 4.0.0 or above.
4. The Proguard version must be 6.2.2 or above.
5. The kotlin-gradle-plugin version must be 1.4.0 or above
6. Using `FlutterFragmentActivity` instead of `FlutterActivity` in `MainActivity.kt`.
7. Colors or custumizations of the SDK for android you can do this by following the steps: [customs](https://docs.y.uno/docs/sdk-customizations-android)
8. Rebuild the app, as the above changes don't update with hot reload

#### IOS
1. Use iOS version 14.0 or above

## Android Configuration
#### build.graddle - project level 
```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url "https://yunopayments.jfrog.io/artifactory/snapshots-libs-release" }
    }
}
```
#### MainActivity.kt

```kotlin
class MainActivity: FlutterFragmentActivity()
```
#### MyApp.kt
According to the documentation, Yuno must be initialized in the Application onCreate. So follow the below steps to achieve the same:
- Setup custom application class if you don't have any.
- Create a custom `android.app.Application` class named `MyApp`.
- Add an `onCreate()` override. The class should look like this:
```kotlin
import android.app.Applicatio
class MyApp: Application() 
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
    }
}
```
- Open your `AndroidManifest.xml` and find the `application` tag. In it, add an `android:name` attribute, and set the value to your class' name, prefixed by a dot (.).
    ```xml
    <application
      android:name=".MyApp" >
    ```
- Now initialize the Yuno SDK inside the `onCreate()` of custom application class according to the following:
```kotlin
import android.app.Application
import com.yuno_flutter.yuno_sdk_android.YunoSdkAndroidPlugin

class MyApp : Application() {
  override fun onCreate() {
    super.onCreate()

    // Add this line with your keys
    YunoSdkAndroidPlugin.initSdk(this, "YUNO_API_KEY")
  }
}
```




## Usage

### Examples
Here are small examples that show you how to use the API.

#### Initialize configuration
<?code-excerpt "readme_excerpts.dart (Write)"?>
```dart
await Yuno.init(
  apiKey: 'your_api_key_here',
  countryCode: 'your_country_code', // The complete list of country_codes is available on https://docs.y.uno/docs/country-coverage-yuno-sdk
  yunoConfig: YunoConfig(
    lang: YunoLanguage.en, //supported languages: ENGLISH, SPANISH, PORTUGUESE, MALAY, INDONESIAN, THAI
    cardflow: CARDFLOW.twoStep, // default cardflow
    saveCardEnable: true, // default saveCardEnable
    keepLoader: true,   // default saveCardEnable 
    isDynamicViewEnable: true, // default isDynamicViewEnable
  ),
  iosConfig: IosConfig(), // Optional, can use default value
);
```

## Yuno Dart API

The library offers several methods to handle Yuno related actions:

```dart
Future<void> startPayment(...);
Future<void> startPaymentLite(...);
Future<void> continuePayment(...);
Future<void> hideLoader(...);
//Avialable only for IOS devices
Future<void> receiveDeeplink(...);
```
## Widgets

### YunoListener
 ```dart
 YunoListener(
   listener: (state) {
     // Handle [state] it is YunoState [String token] && [PaymentStatus status]
     // - [token]: One Time Token
     // - [paymentStatus]: [reject,succeded,fail,processing,internalError,cancelByUser]
     // - [enrollmentStatus]: [reject,succeded,fail,processing,internalError,cancelByUser]
   },
   child: SomeWidget(),
 )
 ```
### YunoPaymentMethods
```dart
YunoPaymentMethods(
  config: PaymentMethodConf(
    checkoutSession: 'your_checkout_session_id',
    // Add other configuration options as needed
  ),
  listener: (context, isSelected) {
    if (isSelected) {
      print('A payment method has been selected');
    } else {
